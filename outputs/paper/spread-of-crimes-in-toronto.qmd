abstract: "This study examines the crime landscape in Toronto during the year 2020, focusing on the relationship between crime rates, income levels, and population figures across neighborhoods using a comprehensive dataset from Open Data Toronto. Our findings reveal an inverse correlation between crime rates and income, indicating that neighborhoods with lower income levels tend to experience higher crime rates. Additionally, a positive correlation emerged between population size and crime rates, suggesting that as the population increases, so does the incidence of crime in Toronto. These insights are crucial for informing targeted policies, enhancing law enforcement strategies, and developing community initiatives to address crime and socio-economic disparities in urban settings."

# Introduction

Toronto, once hailed for its safety, confronts a contemporary challenge as crime rates in its neighborhoods become a growing concern. Despite the overall crime rates across Canada witnessing a commendable 30% decrease in the past two decades [@torontoStats], Toronto has experienced an unsettling rise in criminal activities. This paper embarks on a comprehensive statistical analysis of crime in Toronto neighborhoods throughout the year 2020, delving into the intricate relationship between crime rates, income levels, and population figures.

The global context of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 adds a layer of complexity to the study, prompting an exploration of how crime dynamics unfolded during these unprecedented times. The dataset used for this analysis is meticulously sourced from opendatatoronto [@rOpenDataToronto], providing a granular account of various crimes committed across Toronto's diverse neighborhoods. Utilizing robust statistical tools, particularly R [@citeR], our investigation seeks to unearth nuanced patterns and relationships within the data. It is crucial to note that the emphasis of this study lies in analyzing crimes in general, rather than focusing on a specific crime category.

Preliminary findings allude to the possibility that crime rates in Toronto may deviate from the national trend, warranting a more profound exploration into the intricate dynamics of criminal activities. Acknowledging potential limitations within the dataset, including the influence of racial bias as evidenced in previous studies on crime in Toronto [@censusErrors], underscores the importance of interpreting our findings within a broader socio-economic and cultural context. Understanding these complexities becomes imperative for informed policymaking, strategic law enforcement, and the development of community engagement initiatives.

Beyond statistical analysis, this research delves into the social fabric of Toronto's neighborhoods, offering critical insights into the challenges and opportunities for intervention. @sec-data: Data of the paper will meticulously explore the dataset's characteristics, employing a variety of tables and figures to construct a comprehensive narrative around crime occurrences in Toronto during 2020. @sec-results: Results will delve into the intricate relationships between crime rates, income levels, and population figures, shedding light on correlations and patterns that emerge from the data. It was found that crimes and income are inversely correlated, indicating that as income levels decrease, crime rates tend to increase. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between population size and crime rates, suggesting that as the population increases, so does the incidence of crime. @sec-discussion: Discussion will intricately discuss the implications of these findings within the broader socio-economic context of crime in Toronto, addressing the multifaceted nature of these influences. Finally, the paper will conclude in @sec-conclusion: Conclusion, summarizing key discoveries and proposing avenues for future research in understanding and addressing the complex dynamics of crime in Toronto's neighborhoods.

# Data {#sec-data}

This paper utilises datasets retrieved from Open Data Toronto Portal through the library `opendatatoronto` [@rOpenDataToronto]. Two different data sources were leveraged to analyze the relationship of crimes committed across Toronto with income and population: `Neighbourhood Crime Rates` [@torontoCrimes] for crime data and `Neighbourhood Profiles, 2021 (158 Model)` [@torontoNeighbourhoods] for relevant neighbourhood information. Data was simulated, cleaned , tested and analyzed using the open source statistically programming language R [@citeR], using functionalities from `tidyverse` [@rTidyverse], `ggplot2` [@rGgplot2], `dplyr` [@rDplyr], `readr` [@rReadr], `tibble` [@rTibble], `janitor` [@rJanitor], `kableExtra` [@rKableExtra] and `knitr` [@rKnitr]. Details and examination of the dataset context, variables creation and extraction processes are discussed in the subsections below.


## Number of Crimes Committed in 2020 in Toronto Neighbourhoods

To comprehensively explore crime dynamics in Toronto during the year 2020, the Neighbourhood Crime Rates dataset from the Toronto Open Data portal served as a foundational resource [@rOpenDataToronto]. This dataset, compiled by the Toronto Police Services and last updated on January 11, 2024, encompasses 158 neighborhoods within the Greater Toronto Area. It provides essential information, including the count of various crime types recorded annually between 2014 and  2023 (e.g., Homicide_2020). The crime categories include assault, auto theft, breaking and entering, homicide, robbery, and theft over. However, we only focus on relevant crime data for 2020. The sum of all these crimes committed in 2020 is also included in the cleaned data as the total number of crimes committed in each neighborhood, named `number_of_crimes`.

To ensure a focused examination, the dataset was refined to include specific variables, such as the neighborhood IDs (variable named `hood_id`), neighborhood names (variable named `neighbourhood`), and the total number of crimes for each neighborhood (variable named `number_of_crimes`) in 2020 (see @tbl-cleaned-crimes-data). This focused approach aimed to elucidate the crime landscape within the selected timeframe. Additionally, considerations were made to enhance data visualization by incorporating neighborhood IDs for readability on plot axes. While the raw data included average per crime and crime rate variables, a decision was made to prioritize a total count of all crimes. This strategic choice facilitates a more comprehensive assessment, offering a holistic perspective on crime in Toronto neighborhoods during the specified year.

## Neighbourhood Profiles, 2021 (158 Model)

To capture a comprehensive snapshot of the demographic, social, and economic characteristics of Toronto's neighborhoods, the City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles derived from the 2021 Census of Population played a pivotal role in our analysis. Conducted every five years, the Census collects a wide array of data, including age, sex, families, households, language, immigration, ethnocultural diversity, aboriginal peoples, housing, education, income, and labor. For our study, the Neighbourhood Profiles provided essential insights, offering a nuanced understanding of the people and households within each of the 158 neighborhoods in the City of Toronto.

The dataset is downloadable as a Microsoft Excel file and the `hd2021_census_profile` tab within the dataset was utilized to extract pertinent information for the purpose of this paper. Raw data can transposed and cleaned to extract relevant information such as population (variable named `population`) and average total household income (variable named `income`) for each neighbourhood, identified by variable named `hood_id` in 2020 (see @tbl-cleaned-neighbourhood-profile-data). This information is pivotal in elucidating the economic and demographic landscape of Toronto's neighborhoods, providing a valuable complement to the crime data derived from the Neighbourhood Crime Rates dataset.

    col.names = c("Hood ID", "Popluation", "Income"),
    booktabs = TRUE
  )
```


## Combining Crimes, Income and Population Data

By employing the merge function, we have seamlessly combined cleaned `Neighbourhood Crime Rates` data with cleaned `Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles` data , creating a unified dataset featuring variables including `hood_id`, `neighbourhood`, `number_of_crimes`, `population`, and `income`. 

As illustrated in @tbl-summarized-neighbourhood-profiles, our combined dataset comprises several key variables, each providing crucial insights into the socio-economic and crime landscape of Toronto's neighborhoods. The `hood_id` variable serves as a unique identifier for each neighborhood, facilitating a granular examination of the data. The `neighbourhood` variable delineates the specific neighborhood associated with each observation, enhancing the geographical context. `number_of_crimes` is a numerical variable that quantifies the incidence of crimes within each neighborhood, offering a quantitative measure of criminal activity. Furthermore, `population` and `income` variables contribute additional dimensions to our analysis, shedding light on the demographic and economic characteristics of the neighborhoods. 

These variables collectively enable a comprehensive exploration of the relationships between crime rates, population, and income in Toronto during the year 2020. For example, the first observation in @tbl-summarized-neighbourhood-profiles indicates that the neighborhood with ID 153, named Avondale, experienced 163 crimes in 2020. Additionally, the population of this neighborhood in 2020 was 13,790, and the average total household income was $102,700. These data points can be analyzed together in order to tell us a compelling story about the relationship between crimes, income and population across Toronto neighbourhoods.

## Relationship Between Crimes Committed and Neighbourhood Population

The relationship between crimes committed and neighbourhood population in Toronto is explored in @fig-compare-crimes-population. The scatter plot visually represents this correlation, and a linear regression line indicates the direction of the relationship. The correlation coefficient between the number of crimes and population is approximately 0.564, suggesting a moderately positive correlation. This statistical measure quantifies the tendency for neighbourhoods with larger populations to experience higher crime rates. As an example, consider West Humber-Clairville (Neighbourhood 1), which has the highest population at 33,300. This neighbourhood also ranks second in the total number of crimes with 1175 incidents in 2020, supporting the positive correlation hypothesis. The summary statistics reveal that, on average, Toronto neighbourhoods with larger populations tend to have higher crime rates, contributing to a nuanced understanding of urban safety dynamics.

## Relationship Between Crimes Committed and Neighbourhood Income

The statistical exploration of the relationship between crimes committed and neighbourhood income is depicted in @fig-compare-crimes-income. The scatter plot visualizes this association, while the linear regression line and a correlation coefficient of -0.217 indicate a weak negative correlation. This suggests that, on average, neighbourhoods with higher household incomes tend to have lower crime rates. The negative sign of the correlation coefficient underscores the inverse relationship between these variables. Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills (Neighbourhood 41), Lawrence Park South (Neighbourhood 103), and Rosedale-Moore Park (Neighbourhood 98) are examples of neighbourhoods with the highest household incomes, and they also exhibit relatively lower crime rates. In contrast, neighbourhoods with lower household incomes, such as Oakridge (Neighbourhood 121), North St. James Town (Neighbourhood 74), and Black Creek (Neighbourhood 24), tend to experience higher crime rates. While the correlation is statistically weak, the negative coefficient suggests that higher household incomes are associated with lower crime rates, and vice versa.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

In this paper, an in-depth analysis of Toronto neighbourhoods in 2020 revealed insightful patterns regarding the relationships between crime rates, household income, and population. Through the integration of crime data, neighbourhood profiles, and census information, a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic factors influencing crime emerged. The exploration aimed to shed light on the intricate dynamics that shape the safety landscapes of diverse communities.

One key takeaway from this study is the identification of significant correlations between crime rates and both population and income levels. The positive correlation between population and crime suggests that more densely populated neighbourhoods tend to experience higher crime rates. Conversely, the weak negative correlation between income and crime implies that areas with higher household incomes generally exhibit lower crime rates. These findings underscore the influence of socio-economic factors on crime dynamics, contributing valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners.

The causes for these correlations are multifaceted, reflecting the complex nature of crime in urban settings. For example, the positive correlation between population and crime may be attributed to the increased likelihood of criminal activity in densely populated areas. The presence of more people may provide a sense of anonymity, prompting individuals to engage in criminal activities [@demographicPatterns]. Additionally, the increased population may contribute to a higher incidence of crimes such as theft and assault. Conversely, the negative correlation between income and crime may be explained by the increased likelihood of criminal activity in areas with lower household incomes. The lack of economic opportunities may drive individuals to engage in criminal activities, contributing to higher crime rates [@crimeIncomeRelationship]. Additionally, the presence of more affluent communities may deter criminal activity, contributing to lower crime rates.

Another important observation is the existence of disparities among Toronto neighbourhoods. The summary statistics highlighted distinct neighbourhoods with exceptionally high or low crime rates, providing a nuanced view of the city's safety dynamics. Neighbourhoods like Moss Park and West Humber-Clairville, with high crime rates, and Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills, with a high household income, exemplify the diversity in Toronto's socio-economic landscape. Understanding these disparities is crucial for formulating targeted interventions that address the unique challenges faced by different communities.

While this study offers valuable insights into the crime landscape of Toronto, it is essential to acknowledge potential limitations. The dataset used for this analysis is derived from the Toronto Police Services, which may be subject to racial bias. Previous studies have highlighted the disproportionate impact of policing on racialized communities, particularly Black and Indigenous populations [@censusErrors]. Skogan's seminal work in 1977 emphasizes the existence of unreported crimes, with studies indicating that about two-thirds of Canadians experience criminal incidents that go unreported to the police [@skogan]. This underreporting is particularly pronounced in less severe offenses such as petty theft but extends to more serious crimes like sexual assault, where an alarming 83% of incidents were not reported to the police in 2014. Factors influencing non-reporting include the victim's relationship with the perpetrator, fear of retaliation, and concerns about credibility. Hate crimes, too, are believed to be substantially underreported, often due to strained relationships between marginalized groups and law enforcement, resulting in a lack of confidence in reporting. The consequence of underreporting is a dataset that does not fully capture the true extent of crime and victimization in the city. The characteristics of those who choose to report crimes may systematically differ from those who do not, introducing potential confounds and challenging the accuracy of crime rates, clearance rates, and the equitable allocation of police resources.


Acknowledging these limitations underscores the importance of interpreting our findings within a broader socio-economic and cultural context. Additionally, the dataset does not include information on the specific types of crimes committed, which may have provided a more nuanced understanding of crime dynamics. Future research could explore the relationship between crime rates and specific crime categories, such as assault, homicide, and theft. This would enable a more granular analysis of crime patterns, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the safety landscape in Toronto.


# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

This paper delves into the intricate interplay of crime rates, household income, and population across 158 Toronto neighbourhoods in the year 2020. By integrating crime data, neighbourhood profiles, and census information, our analysis unveils significant correlations that offer nuanced insights into the socio-economic dynamics influencing safety and security. The study reveals a positive correlation between population density and crime rates, indicating that more densely populated neighbourhoods tend to experience higher crime rates. Conversely, a weak negative correlation between household income and crime suggests that areas with higher incomes generally exhibit lower crime rates. The examination of disparities among neighbourhoods, exemplified by areas like Moss Park with high crime rates and West Humber-Clairville with both high crime rates and population, underscores the diversity within Toronto's socio-economic landscape. While these findings contribute to our understanding, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations, such as the absence of causation establishment and the impact of external factors. Future research directions may include longitudinal analyses and the exploration of specific crime types or demographic characteristics for a more comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic determinants of crime in Toronto.
